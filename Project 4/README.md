# COP2535 - Project 4

## Description
Program uses a single stack to determine whether a string read from an 
input file has balanced parentheses.

## Usage
```bash
$ cd <project dir>
$ g++ project4.cpp -o bin/project4
$ ./bin/project4
```
Expected output
```bash
The string found in file ./inputString.txt has 1 more closed `)` than open `(` parentheses!
```
## Note
- Professor preferred that the project was a single file so no header files 
are include.
- Program reads a text file found in the current working directory named 'inputString.txt'
