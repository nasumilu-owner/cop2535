# COP2535 - Data Structures

## Description
This course will focus on the design and analysis of data structures and the use of algorithms. Through the introduction of the most widely used data structures employed in solving commonly encountered problems, such as linked lists, binary trees, queues, and graphs, students will learn different ways to organize data for easy access and efficient manipulation. Algorithms to solve classic problems, such as searching, sorting, hashing, and graph algorithms will also be presented. This course assumes the student has a basic understanding of object-oriented programming in the C++ or Java programming language.[^1]

## Projects
- [Project 1](./Project%201/) bubble & selection sort & linear & binary search comparison
- [Project 2](./Project%202/) reads a string from user input, then an integer, and finally outputs the character found at that offset. The range starts with 0 as the first character.
- [Project 3](./Project%203/) demonstrate a linked list data structure which displays its contents forwards and in reverse.
- [Project 4](./Project%204/) program uses a single stack to determine whether a string read from an input file has balanced parentheses.
- [Project 5](./Project%205/) program builds upon an example found the the classes text by adding a cousin as a node to a Person class. Demonstrates a tree and how to traverse the tree to get list of cousins.
